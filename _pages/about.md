Hello, there. I am an applied economist at Cornell University currently doing research on labor economics and public finance. My work focuses on the effects of employer concentration and M&As on local labor markets, primarily in the context of developing countries. 

You can find my working papers [here](https://jvrcosta.github.io/research/).
