## [Local Labor Market Effects of Mergers and Acquisitions in Developing Countries: Evidence from Brazil](https://jvrcosta.github.io/files/vitor_costa_llm_ma_brazil.pdf){:target="_blank"}
I use matched employer-employee records merged with corporate tax information from 2003 to 2017 to estimate labor market-wide effects of mergers and acquisitions in Brazil. Pairs of commuting zone and industry sector define labor markets. In the following year of a merger, the market size falls by 10.8%. The employment adjustment is concentrated in merging firms. For the firms not involved in M&As, I estimate a 1.07% decline in workers’ earnings and a positive, although not significant, increase in their size. Most mergers have a predicted impact of zero points in concentration, measured by the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI). In spillover firms, earnings decline similarly for mergers with high and low predicted changes in HHI. Contrary to the recent literature on market concentration in developed economies, I find no evidence of oligopsonistic behavior in Brazilian labor markets.
    
## Revolving Doors and Public Procurement 
* with [Dimas Fazio (NUS)](https://sites.google.com/view/dimasfazio){:target="_blank"} 

We explore the relationship between procurement deals within the Brazilian federal government and the contingent of civil service workers switching into private-sector careers. We find preliminary evidence that public sector workers are more likely to work for a private sector firm that has celebrated a contract with their former government divisions. This is suggestive of *quid pro quo*  in the form of career benefits to public sector workers. 
    
## Executives, their Compensation and Entourage 
* with [Thomas Jungbauer (Cornell)](https://thomas-jungbauer.com/){:target="_blank"}

Company directors are highly coveted professionals, not only because of their executive skills but also due to their access to  a wide range of professionals in their industry. We develop a model where potential employers poach executives taking into account the network of human capital these executives have previously interacted with in their career. We verify the predictions of the model using administrative matched employer-employee records form Brazil.  
  
## Distribution of the Public Sector Wage Premium in Brazil
The issue of a public sector wage premium is not any country's exclusivity. Particularly in times of tight fiscal policy, the assessment of how much the public sector pays its employees in excess of the private sector is crucial to tame payroll expenses without compromising the provision of public goods and services. I employ a quantile Oaxaca-Blinder wage decomposition, as in Chernozhukov *et al* (2013) to estiamte what is the wage premium along along the entire wage distribution in the Brazilian formal sector. I encounter that, on average, civil servants earn 23% more compared to their private counterparts, but this difference falls to 6% once observed attributes such as education and experience are taken into account. Employees at the top of the earnings distribution seem to have the least portion of their wages attributed to public sector rents.
